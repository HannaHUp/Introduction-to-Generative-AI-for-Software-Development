    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of Course 1 in the Generative AI for Software Development Specialization! In this assignment you will **work alongside an LLM to take on four different graph-based problems** including finding the shortest path through a graph and solving different variations of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem in which you must find the shortest tour through every vertex in the graph. This is a great opportunity to practice using the LLM skills you've been learning! You can use the LLM of your choosing but [GPT-4o is available here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/ungradedLab/Vuqvf/gpt-3-5-environment), in the ungraded lab that accompanies this assignment.\n",

    "**Here's a quick summary of the contents of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section 1: Introduction, setup, and the `Graph` class this assignment is based on\n",
    "- Section 2: The `Graph_Advanced` class that you will edit for your submission\n",
    "- Section 3: Description of the four exercises you'll implement inside of `Graph_Advanced`\n",
    "- Section 4: A playground to test solutions\n",
    "- Section 5: Unit tests of your `Graph_Advanced` class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a few important points on how this notebook works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Only `Graph_Advanced` is Graded:** You can add new cells to experiment but these will be ignored by the grader. If you want something graded, include it in the provided cell that contains the `Graph_Advanced` class.\n",
    "- **Some Cells are Frozen:** Some cells are frozen, e.g. the `Graph` class, to avoid mistakenly editing their code\n",
    "- **Avoid importing new libraries:** Avoid importing new libraries beyond those you'll find in section 1.1, immediately below. In particular `joblib` or any multiprocessing or parallel computing approach will crash the grader. If you absolutely need additional libraries, import them in the same cell as the `Graph_Advanced` class.\n",
    "- **Save before submitting:** Do this to ensure you are graded on your most recent work.\n",

    "Happy coding!"

    "## 3 - Exercises and Development Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 - Exercises\n",
    "Here are four exercises you'll complete in this assignment. Each one corresponds with a method that is already included in `Graph_Advanced`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1: `shortest_path` (Sparse Graphs, 10,000 nodes, Optimal Solution, 0.5 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge you will be given a large graph with tens of thousands of nodes. The graph is \"sparse\", however, meaning that each vertex may only have edges leading to a few other vertices. You will need to develop an algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices in this graph. The solution will be the length of the path, and the list of vertices along that path. This is a classic computer science problem, and there are a few standard algorithms your LLM is likely to suggest. To ensure your code is efficient, it must execute in less than `0.5` seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2: `tsp_small_graph` (Complete Graphs, 10 nodes, Optimal Solution, 1 second)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem asks you to find the shortest path through a graph that visits all vertices and returns to the start, also called a \"tour\". This problem famously is computationally intensive for large graphs, making it essentially impossible to find the absolute best solution. For smaller graphs, however, a brute force approach is possible, and that's the first version of the Traveling Salesman Problem you'll tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a method that, given a small graph of about 10 nodes, finds the shortest tour of the graph that starts and ends at node 0. Unlike in the first exercise, the graphs here are \"complete\", meaning there is an edge from each node to each other node. The method should return the length of the tour and a list of the nodes visited. **The tour found must be the absolute shortest through the graph.** Your solution must also be efficient, completing the task in under `1` second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3: `tsp_large_graph` (Complete Graphs, 1,000 nodes, \"Pretty Good\" Solution, 0.5 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you again tackle the Traveling Salesman Problem, but for much larger graphs of about 1,000 nodes. Once again the graph is complete, with an edge between every pair of nodes. In graphs this size, a brute force approach is now computationally infeasible, so the tour length requirement on this method has been loosened substantially. You now must simply find a \"pretty good\" tour through the graph using some kind of heuristic approach. There are several commonly-used heuristics, and almost all of them (with the exception perhaps of randomly generating a tour) will produce tours that are short enough to pass the tests on this method. While your solution no longer needs to be optimal, your code should run quickly, in less than `0.5` seconds. Have your LLM focus on speed rather than tour length, and you should find an algorithm that works!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4: `tsp_medium_graph` (Complete Graphs, 300 nodes, Near-Optimal Solution, 1.5 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last version of the Traveling Salesman Problem, you will need to work with an LLM to develop a solution that improves upon the algorithm you used in Exercise 3. Now you will be given complete graphs of about 300 nodes. The time requirement has been relaxed to `1.5` seconds, giving your algorithm 3 times as long to run. The tour length requirements, however, have been tightened, meaning you'll need to find tours that are much closer to the theoretical optimum. This likely means that the heuristic you used in Exercise 3 will no longer produce short enough tours. Brainstorm with your LLM new heuristics you could implement that take advantage of the longer runtime you're allowed and generate relatively shorter tours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 - Recommended Development Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop your solutions alongside an LLM. Here's some steps to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the Problem**: Discuss graph theory problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and shortest path finding with the LLM. Use it to clarify concepts and get examples, enhancing your foundational knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze the `Graph` Class**: Analyze the provided Graph class functions and structure by consulting the LLM. Its explanations will help you understand how to effectively utilize and extend the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brainstorm Solutions**: For each exercise and method (`shortest_path`, `tsp_small_graph`, `tsp_large_graph`, `tsp_medium_graph`), brainstorm with the LLM potential solutions. Share the time constraints and whether the solutions need to be optimal and see which algorithms the LLM recommends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement Solutions**: Have the LLM generate methods that implement the solutions you brainstorm. Ensure the LLM understands the structure of the `Graph` and `Graph_Advanced` class so that the generated code will run as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debug Errors**: Use the LLM to strategize and review your testing approach, especially for tests that yield unexpected results. It can offer debugging and optimization advice to improve your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the LLM Best Practices of \"Be specific\", \"Assign a role\", \"Request an expert opinion\", \"Give feedback\" should serve you well throughout!"
